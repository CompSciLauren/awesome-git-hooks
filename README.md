# Awesome Git Hooks

> :anchor: Easy-to-use git hooks for automating tasks during git workflows.

Git hooks are custom scripts you can use to automate tasks which are triggered before or after a git command is executed. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. This repo contains helpful resources as well as a variety of git hook scripts that can be easily customized to serve different purposes.

:heavy_check_mark: Code is well-documented

:heavy_check_mark: Grab & go! Copy the code you want to use and paste into your .git/hooks folder

## Quick Start

1. Pick a hook, any hook! Try the "verify-name-and-email" one if you're not sure where to start.
2. Navigate to your project's hooks folder (.git/hooks).
3. You should see a list of files already in there. Create a new file called the exact commit type that you want to use (eg: "commit-msg", "pre-rebase", "pre-commit", etc). Do not give it an extension.

4. Open your new file and paste the code from the hook you chose out of this repo (eg: [verify-name-and-email.hook](https://github.com/CompSciLauren/git-hooks/blob/master/pre-commit-hooks/verify-name-and-email.hook)).
5. Save file. Done! Now the git hook will be triggered automatically.
