# Used to check files with the .md extension (markdown) for spelling errors.
# It will run each .md file through aspell and returns an exit code other than 0 when it matches.

# Requirements:
#   * Bash
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-commit".

# Where are the markdown files located?
SEARCH_DIR="content"

# Set some fancy colors to indicate errors and wrongly spelled words.
RED='\033[0;31m'
YELLOW='\033[0;33m'

# Start checking the current directory for md files
